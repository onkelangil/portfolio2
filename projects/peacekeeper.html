					Peacekeeper is an ambient information system which augments the awareness and communication of noise that students produces in dormitories. PeaceKeeper consists of an augmented ear and ball which is illustrated in the image below. The project was publish at the Augmented Human conference in Geneva.
					<br>
					<br>
					The PeaceKeeper concept was discovered in an initial user study with nine students from two different dormitories. It became clear from the study that noise pollution was a big challenge and it interrupted people in doing their homework. However, we also discovered that students were not aware when their neighbor, for instance, could hear the noise they made. The students were actually interested in knowing when people could hear them so they could turn down the volume. Another motivation for the project was to make the system anonymous to avoid conflicts since they live together (regularly you have to knock on the door to ask if they want to turn down the volume).
					<br>
					As seen in the image, the ear has three states, A, B, and C (the light in C is pulsing).

					The A) state is when the surroundings cannot hear you, B) is when your surroundings can hear you (and you have the opportunity to turn down the volume), and C) is when your surroundings can hear noise and squeezes the ball (D) (the ball should be the size of a stress ball) to communicate that the noise annoys them.
					The system was evaluated with users in a small concept validation, and the feedback we received was that the design was nice, the semantics of the colors fit, but that a more noticeable color than white (B) might work better, and that they found the concept valuable and could see themselves use it. 
					<br>
					<br>
					<b class="text-danger">System description</b>: the ear consisted of an ATmega8 (microcontroller), PCB, an XBee (radio communication), MK115 sound detector, and NeoPixels (programmable LEDâ€™s). The augmented ball consisted of an ATmega8, a pressure pad (checks if the ball is squeezed), and XBee.
					<br>

					Unfortunately, there is no video of the project.
