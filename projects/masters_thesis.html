				HeartTale is my masterâ€™s thesis project and it is a data physicalization visualizing group heart rate data from an activity a family had carried out. To break it down, it is a physical graph illustrating family members heart rate during a shared activity of their choosing, this could be a walk in a park or a trip to an amusement park. What we seek investigate were whether families found value in these data physicalizations and if the families would reflect on the good times they have during the week when they saw the physicalizations.
The processes of designing HeartTale can be divided in three parts, 1. Investigating the research field of: personal Informatics, data visualization, data physicalization, data-driven reflection, and heart rate combined with multiple brainstorm sessions. Besides investigating research areas, we did four formative interviews with families to understand their everyday life and their tracking habits. These interviews were analyzed and the results showed that families does not have much quality time during weekdays, mostly when eating dinner or in the weekends. To explore how we could make family reflect on their time together we developed three prototypes, which are illustrated in the picture below. They were a part of a workshop where the families would play three games of Kubb (Viking game) and get the prototypes presented for them. From the analyzes of the data we discovered that the participanting families enjoy the physicalization and would like to bring the home. Further, we found 8 design consideration when designing such system that other designers can use. The last part was the development of Heart-Tale a long-term study where we used the knowledge from our 8 design considerations. What Heart-Tale can is illustrated in the video, and it consist of a dock and a physicalization. The families have themselves taken the pictures and chosen the activity they want to track. The study was conducted with two families and ran for two weeks. What we discovered were that families enjoyed the physicalization and it might have the possibility to change their behavior and spend more time together.
